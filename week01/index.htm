              Auriea Harveys work in digital sculpture is highly innovative, as she creates with the intention of breaking boundaries in the digital media world. Growing up in a segregated area, she let her identity as a black woman play a large role in her creations. As someone who learned to code at such a young age, it is inspiring to see how advanced a person's skills can become. Her work is an example of how the digital world is capable of creating fascinating artwork. Immersive experiences created by artists just like Harvey are the future of sculpting and other kinds of art styles.
