        “As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush gives an insight into the future of how society intakes technology and manages information. The essay presents an idea called the Memex, a machine that stores information and makes it accessible with ease. This is very interesting being that this essay was written in 1945, long before what we know as the internet was invented.
    </div>
    <div class="text-box"> The concept of the Memex that was described by Bush foreshadows what we have now: the World Wide Web. His idea of the Memex also resembled the “mechanics” of the human mind. Bush’s foreshadowing also shows how creative the human imagination is and what it is capable of. “As We May Think” is a revelation to the field of computer science and technological advancements.</div>
